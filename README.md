# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server now auto-detects an open port, starting from `9002`. Set the `PORT` (or `DEV_PORT`) environment variable if you want to pin a specific port.
